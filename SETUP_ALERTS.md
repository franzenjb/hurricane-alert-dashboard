# ðŸŒ€ Hurricane Alert Setup Guide

## How It Works (You Don't Need to Do Anything!)

Your hurricane tracker is **already running automatically** on GitHub! Here's what's happening:

2. **When storms threaten Florida, you get automatic alerts**
3. **The dashboard updates itself** at https://franzenjb.github.io/hurricane-alert-dashboard/
4. **Everything is FREE** - no servers needed!
